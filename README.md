> ðŸ¤– PrimeDAO Smart contracts

This repo contains the smart contracts making up PrimeDAO, the mission of which is to [facilitate wide adoption of open finance by coordinating and cultivating projects that promote safety, reliability, liquidity, and open access](https://docs.primedao.io/primedao/intro).

`/contracts/` is organized as follows:
- `/contracts/incentives/` contains the `StakingRewards` contract for the [PrimeDAO liquidity mining](https://github.com/PrimeDAO/liquidity-mining) scheme. This is a fork of the [StakingRewards](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/blob/develop/contracts/StakingRewards.sol) contract developed by [Synthetix](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix) with few adjustments made to best suit PrimeDAO's needs.
- `/contracts/schemes/` contains the `BalancerProxy` contract, the Configurable Rights Pool proxy for the Prime [Balancer Pool](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0xdd0b69d938c6e98bf8f16f04c4913a0c07e0bb6e/). This is a heavily modified fork of the [ConfigurableRightsPool](https://github.com/balancer-labs/configurable-rights-pool/blob/master/contracts/ConfigurableRightsPool.sol) contract developed by [Balancer Labs](https://github.com/balancer-labs/configurable-rights-pool), adjusted so that ownership and control of the Balancer Pool can be passed to PrimeDAO at the end of the PrimeDAO [Incubation stage](https://docs.primedao.io/primedao/roadmap#incubation).
- `/contracts/utils/` contains interfaces for the ConfigurableRightsPool and BPool contracts.
- `/contracts/vesting/` contains contracts for the [token vesting scheme](https://docs.primedao.io/primedao/tokenomics/roles-and-rewards/vesting-contract-guide).
- `/contracts/PrimeToken.sol` is PrimeDAO's native utility and reward token, [PRIME](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE59064a8185Ed1Fca1D17999621eFedfab4425c9). You can read more about Prime's tokenomics [here](https://docs.primedao.io/primedao/tokenomics).
